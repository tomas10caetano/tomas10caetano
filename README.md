# About Me & Interests

Hi, I'm **Tomás Caetano**, a 3rd-year Engineering Physics student at the University of Porto and a passionate **Quantum Computing enthusiast**.  

I actively take initiative in the field of quantum computing, having participated in the **Qiskit Global Summer School** and the **ETH Summer School on Quantum Computing**. I am also looking forward to joining the **JUNIQ/EPIQ Quantum Computing Summer School** at the **Jülich Supercomputing Center**.  

I am starting to develop my own projects in quantum computing and am eager to engage in more events, workshops, and collaborative opportunities in this exciting field. I also plan to continue my studies by pursuing a **Master's degree in Quantum Information Science and Technology**.

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active at the **gym**, and **football** is one of my biggest passions.
